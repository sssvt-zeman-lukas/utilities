These rumors flyin' just like bullets from a gun
I'm losin' sleep, so tell me should I stay or should I run?
You always steal my voice like a thief in the night
So used to lying down, never put up a fight
But I, I can't keep silent 'cause I finally saw the light
Last night while you were sleeping, sleeping
Packed all your shit, you're leaving, leaving
Found out the secrets you've been keeping, keeping
I should have listened when my friends said
I'd be better off without you
Breathe out, breathe in
I won't be flying off the deep end, deep end
I finally fought off all of my demons, demons
I'm starting over 'cause I opened up my eyes
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping
I hear your stories but they feel so overdone
What's the use in tryin' when we both know that you're not the one
I'm standin' up this time, boy, ready or not
I'm movin' on with life, you should give it a shot
Yeah, you're only sorry 'cause you know that you got caught
Last night while you were sleeping, sleeping
Packed all your shit, you're leaving, leaving
Found out the secrets you've been keeping, keeping
I should have listened when my friends said
I'd be better off without you
Breathe out, breathe in
I won't be flying off the deep end, deep end
I finally fought off all of my demons, demons
I'm starting over 'cause I opened up my eyes
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping
Sleeping
While you were sleeping
Sleeping
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping
