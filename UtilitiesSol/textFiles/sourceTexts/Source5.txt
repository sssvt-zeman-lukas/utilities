The first time we met, the first time together
Took only one look, I knew it forever
Yeah, I could feel, I could feel how my heart kept beating away
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know if I ever gonna see you again
You should know that
Only your heart, your heart
Could tell what to do now
Only your heart, your heart
I'm telling the truth, yeah
I wanna stay in this moment tonight
Baby, yeah, only your heart, your heart
Could make me feel the way I do
I wanted to dance while they were playing
Yeah, I saw you walk, now tell me, what are we waiting for?
Now were you leaving or staying? Yeah, I looked around
You know my heart just skipped a beat and I nearly died
Yeah, baby, yeah
Only your heart, your heart
Could tell what to do now
Only your heart, your heart
I'm telling the truth, yeah
I wanna stay in this moment tonight
Baby, yeah, only your heart, your heart
Could make me feel the way I do
I wanna stay in this moment (tonight)
Baby, yeah, only your heart, your heart
Could make me feel the way I do
