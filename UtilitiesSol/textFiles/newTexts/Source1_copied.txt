Woke up with a dream
That no one would believe
It was burnin' like a fire
They said that I was a liar
I was reaching for the highs
Left everything behind
But they would always come around
They were trying to bring me down
Well they can try again, again
Take your chance, chance
Try again, again
Call me a liar, I'm just getting higher
Try again, again
Take your chance, chance
Try again, again
Call me a liar, I'm just getting higher
Try again, again
Take your chance, chance
Try again, again
Call me a liar, I'm just getting higher
Try again
Never felt like this before
I wanted even more
They say I don't belong
One more reason to prove them wrong
So I'm reaching for the highs
Leave everything behind
But they will always come around
They keep trying to bring me down
Well they can try again, again
Take your chance, chance
Try again, again
Call me a liar, I'm just getting higher
Try again, again
Take your chance, chance
Try again, again
Call me a liar, I'm just getting higher
Try again, again
Take your chance, chance
Try again, again
Call me a liar, I'm just getting higher
Try again
Try again
